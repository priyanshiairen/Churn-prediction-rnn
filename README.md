# Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is a crucial business problem where the goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a company’s services.  
This project uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict customer churn based on demographic and account-related features.

The model is trained on the **Churn Modelling dataset** and deployed using **Streamlit** for real-time predictions.
